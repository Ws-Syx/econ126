\section{Prescott and Summers} Answer the following.
	
	\EN
	\itemp{6} To what does Prescott solely attribute macroeconomic fluctuations? Explain what this means in your own words.
	\itemp{8} Consider the Euler equation from Prescott's RBC model:
		\EE
		\frac{1}{C_t} & = & \beta E_t\left[\frac{\alpha A_{t+1} K_{t+1}^{\alpha-1}L_{t+1}^{1-\alpha} + 1-\delta}{C_{t+1}}\right]
		\FF
	Explain in words why the left-hand side represents the marginal cost to the household of increasing $K_{t+1}$ and explain why the right-hand side represents the marginal benefit.	
	\itemp{6} Summers' fourth critique of Prescott's work ``is that it ignores the fact that partial breakdowns in the exchange mechanism are almost surely dominant factors in cyclical fluctuations.'' Explain what Summers means by \emph{partial breakdowns in the exchange mechanism} and provide an example from reality that is not explained by Prescott's RBC model.
