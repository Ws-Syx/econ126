    "1. The left-hand side is the derivative of the household's period $t$ utility flow with respect to $1-L_t$ and is therefore the marginal utility of leisure. A marginal increase in work effort leads to a marginal decrease in leisure of equal magnitude so the left-hand side of equation (1) reflects the utility cost at the margin of working. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "2. The right-hand side of equation (1) is the marginal product of labor times the marginal utility of consumption. A marginal increase in work effort raises household income, and therefore consumption, by the marginal product of labor: $(1-\\alpha)A_t K_t^{\\alpha}L_t^{-\\alpha}$. Accodring to the chain rule: $\\partial u /\\partial L= (\\partial u /\\partial C)(\\partial C /\\partial L)$, and so equation (1) is the additional utility at the margin of working.<!-- answer -->\n",
    "3. Multiply both sides of equation (1) by $L^{\\alpha}$ and obtain $\\varphi L^{\\alpha}/(1-L_t) = (1-\\alpha)A_tK_t^{\\alpha}/C_t$. Increasing TFP increases the right-hand side and therefore increases labor supplied because the left-hand side is an increasing function of $L$. Intuitively, an increase in TFP increases the margianl product of labor which effectively raises the price of leisure relative to consumption so the household cuts back on leisure. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "4. Increasing consumption decreases labor supplied. Intuitively, an increase in consumption reduces the marginal utility of income, reduces the household's incentive to earn income from working, and so the household takes enjoys more leisure. <!-- answer -->"

    "1. The left-hand side is the derivative of the household's period $t$ utility flow with respect to $C_t$ and is therefore the marginal utility of consumption in period $t$. A marginal increase in saving reduces current consuption by an equal magnitude and so the left-hand side of equation (1) reflects the utility cost at the margin of saving. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "2. The right-hand side of equation (2) represents the marginal benefit to the household of saving because a marginal increase in period $t+1$ capital increases period $t+1$ consumption by the marginal product of capital plus the share of that capital that doesn't depreciate and so, by the chain rule, the increase in the $t+1$ utility flow is: $(\\alpha A_{t+1} K^{\\alpha-1}L^{1-\\alpha}+1-\\delta)/C_{t+1}$. Since the houshold realizes this change in the future, it's discounted by the subjective discount factor $\\beta$. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "3. An increase in TFP in $t+1$ would raise the $t+1$ marginal product of capital and so, since the left-hand side is unchanged, period $t+1$ capital increases to so that the marginal product of capital remains unchanged. Intuitively, an increase in future TFP raises the return to saving (in terms of future consumption) and so the household saves more. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "3. An increase in consumption in $t$ lowers the marginal utility of consumption in period $t$. Therefore the household will try to save more and so period $t+1$ capital increases. Intuitively, a household that suddenly gains more consumption in the current period will try to also increase future consumption by saving more. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "4. An increase in consumption in $t+1$ lowers the marginal utility of consumption in period $t+1$. Therefore the household will try to save less and so period $t+1$ capital increases. Intuitively, a household that suddenly gains more consumption in the next period period will try to also increase current consumption by saving less. <!-- answer -->"
