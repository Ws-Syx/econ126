Countries with high GDP per capita in the initial year had average growth rates that were almost uniformly close to the world average of about 2 percent. Countries with lower GDP per capita in the initial year had much more variation across the average growth rates of their GDP per capita. The countries with the highest growth rates of GDP per capita were among the lowest income initially and the countries with the lowest growth rates of GDP per capita were also among the lowest income initially.<!-- answer -->"

    "1. The estimated coefficient on $y_i$ implies that a \\$1,000 increase in income per captia reduces a states average growth rate of income per capita by 1.2 percent. I.e., states with lower initial income had greater income growth than higher income states. <!-- answer -->\n",
    "2. The R-squared implies that the linear regression model explains about 76 percent of the variation in average income per capita growth across states.<!-- answer -->\n",
    "3. Lower-income US states are \"economically similar\" to higher-income states in that they have the same currency, federal regulation, legal traditions, and language, and they have similar laws, poltical institutions. Therefore, it's not surprising to observe *catch-up growth* among the lower-income states. By contrast, lower-income countries are a diverse group with broad differences in policies and institutions and so it is not at all guaranteed that low income countries will enjoy catch-up growth simply by virtue of their low income. <!-- answer -->"
